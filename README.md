This repository contains the Basic Stats Assignment-1, which involves performing descriptive analysis, data visualization, and data pre-processing on a sales and discounts dataset. The key objectives are to compute basic statistical measures for numerical columns, visualize data distributions using histograms and boxplots, and convert categorical variables to dummy variables using one-hot encoding. Additionally, the assignment includes standardizing numerical variables into z-scores to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning modeling. The code and analysis provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
